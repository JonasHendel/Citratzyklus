As part of my biology class we had to make a graded project about a certain topic, in any way or format we wanted. We were presented with a list off topics and were allowed to choose three of them, one of which we would work on, depending on how many others chose the same. As it had to happen, I didn't get either one off the three topics I chose and ended up with one I would never have thought about choosing, the citric acid circle. A presentation about the citric acid cycle would have bored me to death. So I chose to code a website.</p>

### Features
* Interactive representation of the Citric Acid Cycle
* Hierarchy that helps understand the concept of the Citric Acid Cycle
* Fully responsive
* Simplistic design
* Stimulating colours
* Engaging animations

### Challenges
* I was fairly new to React and Javascript
  * 1.5 months of experience in React, JS and general web development, prior to the project
* The interactive graph of the citric acid cycle was the most challenging part of the project, since I initially had no idea how to go about it.
  * I had to teach myself about SVG
  * Learn how to use Adobe Illustrator



### Critics
Four months, 2 big fullstack projects and lot of learning later, there are some things I would have done different.  
- I would have split up my css in smaller modules, instead of putting almost all my css in `global.css`
- Also I would have added an `onOuterClick` function to the infocard (in the Citric Acid Cycle graph), to display the cover when the user clicks outside of the graph.
